# School Academic Data Management Project

**Introduction:**

This project, School Academic Data Management, is designed to manage academic data efficiently. It utilizes Google Cloud SQL SERVER for the database. To run the application smoothly, you need to set up the IP address in the authorized network of the Cloud SQL SERVER instance.

**Setup Instructions:**

Follow these steps to set up the IP address in the authorized network of the Cloud SQL SERVER instance:

1. **Fetch Your IP Address:**
   - Open Google Chrome and search for "my IP address."
   - Note down the IP address displayed in the search results.

2. **Share Your IP Address:**
   - Please share your IP address with the project administrator.
   - The administrator will add your IP address to the authorized networks of the Cloud SQL SERVER instance.

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/VishwasChaugule/SchoolAcademicDataManagementProject.git
     ```
   
4. **Run the Application:**
   - Navigate to the project directory using the command line.
   - Run the .NET Core MVC application using the following command:
     ```
     dotnet run
     ```

Question

Request response tracing layer in MVC application which should trace all success and all failure requests and responses. Error generated by Authentication and authorization filter and error generated by other action filters should also be traced.


Answer

Created a custom action filter attribute in your MVC application to trace request and response 

public class RequestResponseTracingFilterAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
    {
        public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
        {
            // Log request details (if needed)
            // Example: Log request parameters, headers, etc.
            // Logger.LogRequest(filterContext.HttpContext.Request);

            base.OnActionExecuting(filterContext);
        }

        public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
        {
            if (filterContext.Exception != null)
            {
                // Log exception details (if needed)
                // Example: Logger.LogException(filterContext.Exception);
            }

            // Log response details (if needed)
            // Example: Log response content, status code, headers, etc.
            // Logger.LogResponse(filterContext.HttpContext.Response);

            base.OnActionExecuted(filterContext);
        }
    }


In this filter, OnActionExecuting is called before the action method is executed, and OnActionExecuted is called after the action method has been executed. You can add your logging logic inside these methods to trace the request and response details.
Next, apply the RequestResponseTracingFilterAttribute to the controllers or action methods where you want to enable tracing(I have applied this action filter on all my controller so that it can apply to all action methods in controller):

Example

[RequestResponseTracingFilter]
public class AccountController : Controller   
{
    // Your action methods
}

**Note:** Ensure you have .NET Core SDK installed on your system before running the application. If not, you can download and install it from [Microsoft's official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
